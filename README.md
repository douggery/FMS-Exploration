Linear (traditional) Frequency Modulation Spectroscopy Exploration

Frequency modulation spectroscopy modulates a laser at RF to MW
frequencies generating sidebands which probe an spectroscopic
feature (typically quite narrow ~0.1-100 MHz) and after probing
the feature recombine and mix on a photodetector. Small disturbances
to the relative phase and/or amplitude of the waves cause mismatches
which generates a dispersive lineshape suitable for locking
a laser to that feature.
